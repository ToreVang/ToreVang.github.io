            <h4>Rising criminality</h4>
            San Francisco, the city known for its scenic beauty, diverse population, and cultural landmarks. Over the past decade, San Francisco has seen a sharp rise in theft, with reports of stolen property on the rise. A quick glance at a map highlighting the areas where theft has increased the most between 2011 and 2017 reveals a disturbing trend. Looking at the bar chart below, theft counts in 2005 and 2010 were relatively similar, with around 25 000 reported theft incidents in each year. Theft in San Francisco has been steadily increasing since 2011, with no signs of deceleration. The city's police department has been struggling with the issue for years, trying to come up with ways to check the surge in criminal behavior. Despite their efforts, however, the number of thefts continues to rise.

            <h4>A city for the wealthy</h4>
            To better understand insights into the areas where thefts are most prevalent, we created a heat maps. The map helps us to visualize the concentration of thefts in specific neighborhoods across San Francisco. The map shows that a few specific reagions contribute to most of the crime done in San Francisco. One possible factor driving the surge in theft is the city's increasing wealth gap. San Francisco is one of the most expensive cities in the world to live in, with high costs of housing, transportation, and food. As the cost of living in San Francisco continues to rise, many residents are struggling to make ends meet. This economic pressure may be driving some individuals to turn to theft as a means of survival. In a study by the Public Policy Institute of California, researchers found that poverty rates in San Francisco have been on the rise in recent years. In 2017, the city's poverty rate was 12.9%, up from 11.9% in 2011. This increase in poverty rates may be contributing to the rise in theft rates, as individuals who are struggling financially may be more likely to engage in criminal behavior. Another potential factor contributing to the rise in theft is the theft of electronic devices and other high-value items. San Francisco is home to many technology companies, and as a result, the city has a large number of residents who own expensive equipment. According to the SFPD, thefts of electronic devices such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets have been on the rise in recent years.

            <h4>Initiatives for crime control</h4>
            <p> In response to the surge in theft, the city has taken steps to address the issue. In 2016, the San Francisco Police Department launched the "Lock it or Lose it" campaign, which encourage people to secure their personal belongings properly. In addition, the city has also invested in new technology, such as surveillance cameras and license plate readers to deter theft and identify potential suspects. These efforts aim to make San Francisco a safer place. Despite efforts made by the city to address the rising theft rates, some experts and journalists believe that more needs to be done to tackle the root causes of the issue. A journalist for the San Francisco Examiner, J. F. Rodriguez, advocates for a more proactive approach by investing in programs to a to alleviate poverty and increase access to affordable housing. Such programs could potentially address the economic factors that contribute to theft. <br>
            
            The other cities have found success in implementing innovative strategies to fight a theft. For example, New York City's NYPD launched Operation Impact, a program that focused on increasing police presence in high-crime areas, resulting in a significant reduction in crime rates by over 30%. As San Francisco continues to struggle with the issue of theft, residents will need to remain vigilant and take steps to protect themselves and their property. Only by working together can the city overcome this challenge and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever before. <br>

            <h4>Types of crimes</h4>
            The bar chart below gives a insight into the 15 crimes with highest occurence. In this plot it can be seen that a few crimes contribute a lot while many stay the same or actually decrease. The crime types that increase are theft from auto, vandalism, petty theft from property. While threats against life actaully decrease. This also shows that the increase in crimes are of a especially bad character. </p>
