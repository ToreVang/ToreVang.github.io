            <h4>Importance of trees in cities</h4>
            Cities around the world are getting bigger and should be suited for the increasing amount of people moving to them. There are many problems connected to building big cities, and trees offer a part of the solution to many of these problems. Street trees serve several important tasks: They provide protection against watersheds, by maintaining soil strength using their roots, temperature reduction by giving shade to surrounding buildings and roads, air pollution reduction and aesthetics to the city. Apart from this, studies have shown that trees have a positive phycilogical effect on the people in the neighborhood such as reduced crime rates, higher occupancy and property value (Miller, 2007). <br>
            <h4>Development of street trees in Copenhagen</h4>
            Copenhagen is a city that have been focusing a lot on street trees over the past many years. This tendency is shown in the figure below of the development of planted trees in Copenhagen from 1920 to 2022. It both gives the number of trees planted but also the number of different species planted. When planting many trees it is important to be aware that it is a big risk to plant similar trees. Biodiversity is important to avoid dicease spreding to all tree in an area, it is also important to ensure more wildlife. 
            The plot gives a clear impression that Copenhagen is focusing on planting trees and that biodiversity is a key factor when choosing trees. This does however not say anything about how many trees died or where cut down due to other reasons.

            <h4>Species</h4>
            The species of trees also differ much from region to region, one thing across many regions is that biodiversity is favored. The plot below shows a stacked area plot for the development of the planted species for all regions in copenhagen over years from 1920 to 2023. Tree planting is often a part of a big project, why a few year has many houndres of planted trees and other years have none. To make the plot visualizable a smoothing was applied to even out all the bumbs. 
            In copenhagen Lind is the far most planted tree, this is because this was almost the only tree planted the earliest years, expect from a few regions like Brønshøj-Husum who has planted a steady amount of oaks from 1920 to 2023.

            <h4>Difference between trees</h4>
            <!-- Here comes the story! About how copenhagen choose to focus on certain areas, not related to population or area!! :O wow what a story -->
            Street trees thus both have physical, social and economical positive impacts and are therefore important in all cities. Street trees are however not equally representet in every part of Copenhagen, neither in terms of amount of trees or species. In the figure below is a combined bar chart of every part of Copenhagen showing the density of trees and trees/population ratio both normalized. The data is taken from a big dataset, that dates all planted trees spanding from 1920 to 2023. It thus means that any existing tree before 1920 was not included in this dataset. To include population size and area another dataset was included. <br>
            If all parts of copenhagen was equally represented with trees the ratios on the chart should be somewhat equal, there is however a big difference between different parts. regions with a high tree to population ratio is the regions that should be expected to be the welthiest. Indreby and Østerbro are the regions with the highest number of trees pr citizen. And Nørrebro and Østerbro are the regions with the highest density of trees. This makes Østerbro favorable. 
            Many regions are very low compared to Østerbro, Nørrebro and Indre by, but this might be misleading, since the far largest region "Amager vest", which consist of a large amount of old forest, this is not in the dataset used.

            <h4>city of the ewlpthy</h4>
            <p> In response to the surge in theft, the city has taken steps to address the issue. In 2016, the San Francisco Police Department launched the "Lock it or Lose it" campaign, which encourage people to secure their personal belongings properly. In addition, the city has also invested in new technology, such as surveillance cameras and license plate readers to deter theft and identify potential suspects. These efforts aim to make San Francisco a safer place. Despite efforts made by the city to address the rising theft rates, some experts and journalists believe that more needs to be done to tackle the root causes of the issue. A journalist for the San Francisco Examiner, J. F. Rodriguez, advocates for a more proactive approach by investing in programs to a to alleviate poverty and increase access to affordable housing. Such programs could potentially address the economic factors that contribute to theft. <br>
            The other cities have found success in implementing innovative strategies to fight a theft. For example, New York City's NYPD launched Operation Impact, a program that focused on increasing police presence in high-crime areas, resulting in a significant reduction in crime rates by over 30%. As San Francisco continues to struggle with the issue of theft, residents will need to remain vigilant and take steps to protect themselves and their property. Only by working together can the city overcome this challenge and emerge stronger and more resilient than ever before. <br>
            <h4>Types of crimes</h4>
            The bar chart below gives a insight into the 15 crimes with highest occurence. In this plot it can be seen that a few crimes contribute a lot while many stay the same or actually decrease. The crime types that increase are theft from auto, vandalism, petty theft from property. While threats against life actaully decrease. This also shows that the increase in crimes are of a especially bad character. </p>
